# Builders Challenge Reference

A deeper dive into the architecture behind [README.md](README.md) — the models, the
DataEngine pipeline, and the full video corpus. Team setup and credentials are covered
there; this doc doesn't repeat them.

---

## Models (NVIDIA on CoreWeave)

Inference for the pipeline runs on shared **GPU endpoints** (NVIDIA Cosmos + YOLO + Canary). You don’t deploy the models yourself.

| Model | Role in VSS | Endpoint (env var, in `/config/<team>.config`) |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **NVIDIA Cosmos3-Reason** (`nvidia/cosmos3-reason`) | Video understanding / reasoning over segments | `$COSMOS3_REASON_URL` |
| **YOLO11** (`yolo11s`, Ultralytics) | Object detection (bounding boxes / labels) | `$YOLO_URL` |
| **NVIDIA Cosmos Embed1** (`nvidia/cosmos-embed1`) | Text and visual embeddings (256-dim) for hybrid search | `$COSMOS_EMBED1_URL` |
| **NVIDIA Canary-1B** (`nvidia/canary-1b`) | Speech-to-text (ASR) + speech translation — **not** Cosmos; NeMo audio model | `$CANARY_1B_URL` |

Each model has its own host and port; don't assume they share a host. No auth token is
needed to call them. Ask Cursor / see `.cursor/skills/gpu/` for how to call each model.

Ingest and search call **Cosmos3-Reason**, **YOLO11**, and **Embed1** through your pipeline and backend today.

**Canary-1B** is not wired into the current VSS pipeline. If you want audio transcripts, spoken-word search, or speech translation in your demo — let your imagination go and hook it in. **Ask Cursor how to use Canary-1B** against your stack and skills.

## Data Engine

### VSS Blueprint

Your team’s ingest runs as a **VAST DataEngine** serverless pipeline. A video chunk lands in S3, then functions run in sequence until searchable rows exist in VastDB.

```
S3 chunks (bucket)  →  Segmenter  →  S3 segments (bucket)
                                           ↓
                                        Detector → Reasoner → Embedder → VastDB writer
```

A separate **events / prompt-suggester** function runs on a schedule and feeds UI suggestions.

![VAST DataEngine pipeline](docs/hackathon/vss-pipeline.png)

**VAST DataEngine (pipeline’s tab)** — view the pipeline’s flow, logs, and traces. Treat the graph as given for the challenge (re-ingest / upload via skills; don’t rebuild functions or redeploy the pipeline).

| Function | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| **Segmenter** | Splits each uploaded chunk into short fixed-length clips and writes them to the segments bucket. **Builders challenge:** organizers already used the Segmenter to pre-ingest your corpus. During the challenge you **only re-ingest** data that is already segmented and indexed — the Segmenter is **not** in the path you run. |
| **Detector** | Runs **YOLO11** on each segment and records object classes, counts, and bbox sidecars. |
| **Reasoner** | Calls **NVIDIA Cosmos3-Reason** to write a searchable natural-language description of the segment. |
| **Embedder** | Calls **NVIDIA Cosmos Embed1** to build text (and visual) vectors for hybrid search. |
| **VastDB writer** | Persists embeddings, reasoning, detections, and metadata as a row in your VastDB collection. |
| **Events (prompt-suggester)** | Periodically scans recent segments and writes suggested search prompts / key events for the UI. |

**Builders challenge note:** your archive is **pre-ingested** (Segmenter already ran). Your live path is **re-ingest** on existing segments: Detector → Reasoner → Embedder → VastDB writer (via `ingest/reingest-videos` / `reingest-chunk`). You don’t upload new chunks or invoke the Segmenter for this challenge.

You don’t need to redeploy this graph for the hackathon — treat it as the engine behind search, dashboard, suggestions, and re-ingest.

## What you were given

For your team you already have:


| Piece | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **Ingest pipeline** | DataEngine graph that pre-ingested your corpus (Segmenter already ran). During the challenge you **re-ingest** existing segments (detect → reason → embed → write VastDB) |
| **UI** | Web app at your `INGRESS_URL` (frontend + backend) |
| **S3 buckets** | Chunks + segments for uploads |
| **VastDB** | Indexed segments, embeddings, detections, reasoning text |
| **This repo in Cursor** | Agent **skills** that know how to call every important API — open this project in Cursor and describe what you want |
| **Source code repo** | Full VSS Blueprint (`vss-blueprint`) — optional reading; the live stack is already up |

```bash
cd /vss-blueprint
```

Cloning the Blueprint is **not a requirement**. The live UI, APIs, and Cursor skills in this repo are enough for a strong demo — search, filters, re-ingest, upload, dashboards, mini-apps on top of the archive. Do not rebuild or redeploy DataEngine ingest functions for the challenge.

Open the UI, log in with your team user, and open **this skills repo** in **Cursor**. Skills are how you move fast against the live APIs.

## Video corpus (already indexed)

Your team’s VSS archive is **pre-ingested** from the lab corpus below. Explore and **re-ingest** with the prompt/metadata you need (`ingest/reingest-videos` / `reingest-chunk`).

**One pipeline, one VastDB index, several operational lenses.** Only `scenario` + metadata change. Anchor demo line:

> *Show me every clip, from any camera in any site, where a person is close to a moving vehicle*

That should pull I-24 highway traffic, Toronto live driving, neighborhood / SF street cams, and warehouse forklift / aisle views into one result set.

Search UI filters (upload metadata): `camera_id`, `capture_type`, `location`, plus **object class** from detections. Corpus tables below also list a Category column for demo grouping — that is not a filter field. For re-ingest, set analysis `scenario` (presets: `surveillance`, `traffic`, `live_driving`, `retail`, `warehouse`, `egocentric`, `sports`, `nhl`, `general`).

### Use-case groups

#### 1. Highway Multi-Cam Traffic — `traffic`

| Source | Location | Category | `camera_id` | What’s indexed |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| I-24 / 3D traffic | nashville | Traffic | `i24_cam-1` | ~51 multi-cam highway clips (`scene*_p*c*`) |

Multiple cameras per scene. Story: congestion, lane behavior, vehicle–vehicle interaction on a highway corridor. Try: *“truck changing lanes”*, *“dense traffic on the highway”*, *“vehicle braking hard.”*

#### 2. Live Driving & Road Safety — `live_driving` / `streets`

| Source | Location | Category | `camera_id` | What’s indexed |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| PIE drives | toronto | Streets | `pie_cam-3` | **6** long drive sets (`set01` … `set06`) |

Forward-facing / on-road drives. Story: road-scene understanding and driving safety. Try: *“pedestrian near the curb”*, *“intersection with turning traffic”*, *“vehicle ahead braking.”*

#### 3. Neighborhood Street Surveillance — `surveillance` / `streets`

| Source | Location | Category | `camera_id` | What’s indexed |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Neighborhood cars | neighborhood | Streets | `neighborhood_cam-1` | **2** day merges (2026-09-01, 2026-09-02) |

Residential / neighborhood car activity. Story: street-level vehicle events over time. Try: *“car passing in front of houses”*, *“two vehicles close together”*, *“vehicle stopping at the curb.”*

#### 4. SF Street Surveillance — `surveillance` / `streets`

| Source | Location | Category | `camera_id` | What’s indexed |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| SF streets | san_francisco | Streets | `sf_streets_cam-1` … `sf_streets_cam-4` | **4** street cameras (`sf-streets/1` … `4`) — **ingesting soon** |

Fixed San Francisco street cams. Story: urban street activity across multiple viewpoints. Try: *“pedestrians crossing while cars wait”*, *“busy intersection”*, *“same moment from two SF cameras.”*

#### 5. Warehouse Safety & Operations — `warehouse`

| Source | Location | Category | `camera_id` | What’s indexed |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| SDG warehouse RGB | warehouse3 | Warehouse | `sdg_warehouse_cam-2` | ~178 short ceiling / aisle clips |

Industrial **safety & near-miss** search — *“forklift near a person in an aisle”*, *“pallet in a walkway”*, *“person in a restricted zone.”*

#### 6. Indoor / Smart-Space Surveillance — `surveillance` / `crowds`

| Source | Location | Category | `camera_id` | What’s indexed |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Smart spaces | indoor | Crowds | `smartspace_cam-1` | ~102 indoor / facility camera clips |

Occupancy, people flow, and facility ops. Try: *“person walking through an aisle”*, *“group of people near equipment”*, *“empty corridor.”*

### Cross-group demos (the payoff)

| Query | Hits across groups |
|-------|--------------------|
| *“person close to a moving vehicle”* | I-24 (1) + Toronto driving (2) + neighborhood (3) + SF streets (4) + warehouse (5) |
| *“dense traffic / many vehicles”* | I-24 multi-cam (1) + PIE sets (2) + neighborhood (3) + SF streets (4) |
| *“person in a warehouse aisle”* | SDG RGB (5) + smartspaces (6) |
| *“same city, different camera”* | SF: `sf_streets_cam-1` … `sf_streets_cam-4` |

### Recommended demo packs

Don’t try to demo everything at once. Start with a short pack, prove search → filters → UI, then expand.

| Pack | Sources | Story |
|------|---------|-------|
| **A — Highway Traffic** | I-24 multi-cam | Corridor traffic |
| **B — Live Driving** | PIE sets 01–06 | On-road / road-safety |
| **C — Warehouse Safety** | SDG RGB | Near-miss + aisle ops |
| **D — Neighborhood Streets** | Neighborhood day 01–02 | Day-scale street vehicles |
| **E — SF Streets** | SF cams 1–4 | Multi-cam urban streets (**ingesting soon**) |
| **F — Indoor Smart Spaces** | Smart spaces cams | Facility / indoor crowds |

Start with **Pack A (Highway Traffic)** or **Pack C (Warehouse Safety)** — high-signal — before leaning on the long PIE / Neighborhood day merges. Add **Pack E (SF Streets)** once those cameras are indexed.

### Example queries

- *“Truck changing lanes on the highway”* → `i24_cam-1`
- *“Pedestrian near the road while driving”* → `pie_cam-3`
- *“Car passing houses on a residential street”* → `neighborhood_cam-1`
- *“Busy San Francisco intersection”* → `sf_streets_cam-1` … `sf_streets_cam-4`
- *“Forklift approaching a person in a warehouse aisle”* → `sdg_warehouse_cam-2`
- *“Person walking through an indoor corridor”* → `smartspace_cam-1`
- *“Person close to a moving vehicle”* → cross-pack (A + B + C + D + E)

## Suggested playbook

Write full prompts in Cursor: name what you want, point at your team config, and say what to build. A solid loop is **re-ingest → confirm indexing → ship a thin app on search / videos / dashboard**.

### Example prompts (adapt to your use case)

**1. Re-ingest and verify indexing**

> Re-ingest an indexed video from Pack A (Highway Traffic) or Pack C (Warehouse Safety) in my team environment (credentials in `/config/<my-team>.config`).
> Let me pick the target (e.g. an I-24 scene clip or an SDG warehouse clip), prompt/metadata behavior, and chunk count.  
> Wait until re-ingest finishes, then run basic sanity checks on counts and pipeline health.  
> *(Cursor will use skills: `ingest/reingest-videos`, `retrieval/dashboard`, `retrieval/login`)*

**2. Cross-camera “person near vehicle” board**

> Build a small webpage that answers: *“person close to a moving vehicle”* across my archive.  
> Group hits by `location` / `camera_id` (Nashville I-24, Toronto driving, neighborhood streets, SF streets when indexed, warehouse).  
> For each hit, show a triptych: one clip **before**, the **event**, and one clip **after** (~5 seconds each).  
> Deploy it **on Kubernetes** (not local) to my team namespace without Docker build/push — Ingress path `/app` on my team host.  
> *(Cursor will use skills: `retrieval/login`, `retrieval/search`, `retrieval/videos`, `retrieval/list-metadata`, `deployment/deploy-app-no-registry`)*

**3. Warehouse safety ops board**

> Build a standalone page for Pack C: histogram of top detected objects + a list of near-miss style hits  
> (forklift near a person, tight aisle, person in a walkway). For each object, show a small bounding-box crop from a real segment.  
> Filter by `camera_id` / `location`. Deploy on K8s at `/app` (or save under `tools/` while iterating), then report the top findings.  
> *(Cursor will use skills: `retrieval/login`, `retrieval/dashboard`, `retrieval/search`, `retrieval/videos`, `deployment/deploy-app-no-registry`)*

## Rules of the road

- Stay in **your** team credentials, buckets, and UI. Don’t poke other teams’ namespaces.
- Prefer **Cursor + skills** over hand-copying curl forever — but reading a skill once to understand the API is encouraged.
- Don’t burn the whole hackathon redeploying infrastructure; the stack is already up.
- If search returns nothing: check login, check dashboard/pipeline alignment, then check that metadata filter values actually exist (`retrieval/list-metadata`).
- Have fun — the win is a crisp story: *problem → video archive (one of the packs) → search/filters across cameras → insight or action*.
